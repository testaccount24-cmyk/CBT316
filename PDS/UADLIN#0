Notes on the UADLIST program.  (Usefulness and so forth.)

The purpose of the UADLIST command nowadays is principally to determine
if there are any rogue entries in SYS1.UADS that would allow LOGON to
the system when RACF didn't know about that userid, especially those
that didn't need a password to LOGON.

Sometimes this can be a good thing when you need a backdoor.  But,
a backdoor is a backdoor, and these things should be controlled by
the installation.  You don't want an unsupervised backdoor.

I would recommend running the CLIST UADL on a regular basis, to check
and see what your SYS1.UADS looks like.

Updates:   (courtesy of Bill.)

1.  Updated to show member name instead of internal name of the userid.
    The pds member name (minus the 0 or 1..... suffix) is what you
    log on to as the userid.  The internal name is ignored by LOGON.
    If the member name differs from the internal userid name, a +
    is displayed to show that the two id's are different.

2.  Fixed abends or errors that occurred when no password or account
    number was present.

3.  Fixed abends which occurred because members were copied from a
    UADS dataset that was larger in blocksize than the present one.
    That still does not fix the UADS entry to make it fit for LOGON
    purposes, but at least the UADLIST program reports the situation
    properly, and does not abend.
