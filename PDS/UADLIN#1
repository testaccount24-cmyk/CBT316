Hi Sam,

I have changed the UADLIST program to handle this without
abending.

The problem is that this UADS has a blocksize of 8000, and it
contains some records that originally had a blocksize of 17200,
and were truncated to 8000, losing information in the process.
There should be 215 80-byte records (17200 bytes) but there are
only 100 (8000 bytes). The original blocksize is in the first 2
bytes of each member. The UADSPWD1 field at offset 24 is the
offset to where the password and account information is located,
and the offset is greater than 8000 for some of the members.

What the program now does is check if that offset exceeds the
actual blocksize, and prints other information in the password,
account, and proc fields of the output file.

For example, the first member has this problem, so the output
will now look like this:
BLIN   (+16960)  (*17200)  (=08000)      0000 OPER ACCT JCL MOUNT CONS

The first number is the offset in the UADSPWD1 field. The second
number is the original block size. The third number is the actual
block size.

I also noticed that several members have a userid in the data
record which does not match the member name. The program has
always printed the userid from the data record, not from the
member name. The program will now put a "+" plus sign after the
userid if it doesn't match the member name.
