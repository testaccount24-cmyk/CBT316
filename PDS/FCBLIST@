Attached is an update to the FCBLIST program in File 316.  I have
been working a project to get rid of some COMPUTERM Channel
Extenders. Along the way CNT purchased Computerm and then bought
INRANGE.  Then McData bought CNT. Anyway McData has dropped
support for the hardware and I have some IBM 6262 printers
channel extended up in the cave we have space within north of
Pittsburgh.  So I have replaced them with some $1800 EPSON
DFX-5000 Dot Matrix IP printers.  It is much cheaper.  The IBM 6262
printers were printing special forms with some FCBs.  The FCB
did not quite work when you moved things over to the Dot Matrix
and we were striving to understand why.

The FCBLIST program has been around for years since I found it
back in the late 1970s.  I started looking at it and also I looked
around to see if anyone had updated it; never found anyone.  So I
decided to document it and learn something along the way and to
also add IBM 4248 support or FCB4.  Besides it gives me a chance
to keep my hand in coding.

I know that you are taking care of File 316 so if you could just
update the one to this version of the code.  When I get time, I
will update the program to Version 3 and also fix a few
discrepancies in the code.  They are not causing any grief now,
but some assumptions are in error.

Thanks   Jim
